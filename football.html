It was the third ceremony during which awards were presented based on the results of the season instead of the calendar year, specifically the period from 1 August 2023 to 31 July 2024. The nominees were announced on 4 September 2024 and the ceremony took take place on 28 October 2024.[2][3] Two new accolades were awarded: Men's Coach of the Year and Women's Coach of the Year, recognizing the contribution of coaches to success on the pitch.[2] UEFA co-organized the Ballon d'Or gala for the first time, while France Football retained the voting system and the Ballon d'Or name.[2][4]

        For the first time, both the men's and women's Ballons d'Or were awarded to players from the same country, with Rodri and Aitana Bonmatí coming from Spain,[5] in addition to the Kopa Trophy being also awarded to Lamine Yamal, also from Spain.[6]</p>
