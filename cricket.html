    <p>Heading into the final fixture, Nepal were two points behind UAE, who had been undefeated in the tournament to that point. To claim World Cup qualification, Nepal not only needed to chase down UAE's target, but had to do so at a rate to pass their rivals on net run rate.

        The Nepalese batters delivered under pressure, achieving the target comfortably in just 14.4 overs to secure the final U19 Women's T20 World Cup 2025 spot.
        
        This win was a big boost to Nepal as they had a commanding victory against UAE, to whom they had lost earlier in the tournament. Krishma Gurung bagged four wickets and was supported by Riya Sharma and Seemana KC both of whom took two wickets apiece</p>
